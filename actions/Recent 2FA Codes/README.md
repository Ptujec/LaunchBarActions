# Recent 2FA Codes

Action to quickly grab 2FA codes received via iMessages app.
The action retrieves the 5 most recent messages that include a code between 4 and 8 digits long. It only looks at incoming SMS messages of the last 24 hours.

Codes are returned as text, so all standard text features of LaunchBar will work:
* ⌘C to copy the code
* ⇧⌘C to copy and paste the code in one go
* ⇧↩ to insert the code in the front-most window
* ⇥ to send it to a different app or item inside LaunchBar.

**Dependencies & Requirements:**
- Make sure you are receiving SMS message in iMessage. You probably need to have an iPhone next by and SMS forwarding turned on.
- LaunchBar needs to have Full Disk Access, else it can not read the iMessage database.
